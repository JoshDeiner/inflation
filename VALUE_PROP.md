## Value Proposition

This tool provides transparency into the nuanced impacts of inflation on your community, allowing you to ask questions and make informed decisions. By offering detailed insights and data, we hope to empower you to better plan for your future.

## Problem Statement

Most financial planning apps overlook the specific effects of inflation on individuals. While small differences in portfolio returns over time are often highlighted by financial leaders, the impact of inflation is equally critical but less understood.

The reliance on inflation indexes may not accurately reflect the personal price changes experienced by individuals. For example, a [Vanguard study](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/personalized_inflation_hedging.pdf) suggests that people with average lifestyles are more sensitive to the effects of inflation during their working years and less so in retirement.
